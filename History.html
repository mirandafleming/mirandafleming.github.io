			<div class = "histBox">
				<p>
					What began as a map of a disease outbreak in London in 1854 has become the vast field of GIS as we know it today. 
					The rise of computers from the 60’s into the 80’s drove the growth and development of GIS with projects like CGIS, considered by some to be “roots” of modern GIS. 
					Within this time period also arose the GBF-DIME from the US Census Bureau, and topographic map development by the Ordnance Survey in the UK. 
					With the early 80’s came the rise of Esri, now one of world’s most prominent GIS software developers. 
					So too around this time did GIS software enter the commercial market in earnest. 
					Now with the user base continually expanding and the explosion of open source software and freely available data, the field of GIS is only expected to grow.

			<h3 class = "histH2">Our Company</h3>

			<div class = "histBox">
				<p>
					Founded in 2019 by a small group of Fleming College GIS students, NKBM Consulting has not strayed from its roots. 
					Still run and operated by its original team, the company has never lost sight of its core values. 
					Quality services from highly skilled professionals at an accessible price point for projects big and small. 
					Whether it be remotely assessing the health of a crop field, mapping utilities for a development, or surveying parcel boundaries, 
					no project has been too challenging.
